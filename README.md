# CCMU: CRISPR-Cas9 Offâ€‘target Prediction

CCMU (Combined Multi-feature Unified model) is a Transformer-based classifier for predicting CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity. The model integrates nucleotide sequence context with ten epigenetic tracks and was trained using five-fold cross-validation. This repository provides scripts to download the example dataset and run inference using the released weights.
