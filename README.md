# CCMU: CRISPR-Cas9 Offâ€‘target Prediction

![Cover](docs/Cover.png)

CCMU (Combined Multi-feature Unified model) is a Transformer-based classifier designed to predict CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity. The model integrates nucleotide sequence context with ten epigenetic tracks and was trained using five-fold cross-validation.

## Data Source

## Running Inference

Choose the inference script depending on the configuration you wish to evaluate:

```bash
python infer_combined.py        # sequence + epigenetic features
python infer_seq_only_model.py  # sequence features only
python infer_epi_only.py        # epigenetic features only
```
